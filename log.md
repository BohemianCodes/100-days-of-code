## [***Update on Day 12:*** These are now 100 Days of LearningToCode]

### Day 1: May 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on freeCodeCamp's jQuery challenges

**Thoughts:** Re-gaining some motivation, I think there is an amazing coding community out there and a whole world to explore.

### Day 2: May 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started the first freeCodeCamp project: Create a tribute page with Codepen and Bootstrap. 

**Thoughts**: I just got thrown into cold Bootstrap water. Luckily there is W3Schools and Ray Vilalobos!

### Day 3: May 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Tribute Page on freeCodeCamp, and continued with Ray Villalobos' course "Bootstrap 4" on lynda.com

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap is cool and fun. But I do have to keep notebook and pen closeby while learning all the bootrap css classes.

### Day 4: May 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: In order to be able to build freeCodeCamp's second project (a single-page Bootstrap portfolio site) I continued with Ray's awesome "Bootstrap 4" course. I implemented some of the things I learnt into my existing Jim Jarmusch-tribute page. After, I worked a few hours on my website http://www.bohemiancodes.com/education

**Thoughts**: I am delighted by how great it is to learn Bootstrap and how much fun it is to use it. I understand that learning mobile-first and general responsive design is a key skill for future jobs.

### Day 5: May 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: A full Bootstrap Saturday. Ray's course again, and advancing slooooowwwwwly with my freeCodeCamp portfolio project. 

**Thoughts**: Today I found Bootstrap confusing, probably because I work with only a little knowledge while I feel quite confident with CSS already. I am happy with the look of the page though.

### Day 8: May 23, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Simon Allardice's course "Programming Foundations" on lynda.com and learnt the meaning of functions & parameters.  

**Thoughts**: I know I am supposed to actually code myself every day, but I can't commit to that always. As long as I have a full time job and return home drained, I am happy I am able to follow and understand some of the basics of JavaScript.

### Day 10: June 4, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Prepared for Skillcrush's course "Freelance Wordpress Developer" which starts tomorrow!

**Thoughts** I've decided to make this log about the progress of my coding skills - not take it literal of ACTUAL coding every day. It is too early in my career. But I am so happy I took the leap into a real course!

### Day 11: June 5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp (JavaScript)


### Day 12: June 7, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started the JavaScript section of Rob Percival's Web Developer course on Udemy. 

**Thoughts** This is amazing, because after so much JavaScript theory (Algorithms, Functions, Arrays etc.) in my other courses, Rob started right away with hands-on code that did stuff to a html site, like clicking buttons and changing the inner HTML of paragraphs. This motivated me a lot.
