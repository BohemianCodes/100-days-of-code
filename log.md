# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on freeCodeCamp's jQuery challenges

**Thoughts:** Re-gaining some motivation, I think there is an amazing coding community out there and a whole world to explore.

### Day 2: May 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started the first freeCodeCamp project: Create a tribute page with Codepen and Bootstrap. 

**Thoughts**: I just got thrown into cold Bootstrap water. Luckily there is W3Schools and Ray Vilalobos!

### Day 3: May 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Tribute Page on freeCodeCamp, and continued with Ray Villalobos' course "Bootstrap 4" on lynda.com

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap is cool and fun. But I do have to keep notebook and pen closeby while learning all the bootrap css classes.

### Day 4: May 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: In order to be able to build freeCodeCamp's second project (a single-page Bootstrap portfolio site) I continued with Ray's awesome "Bootstrap 4" course. I implemented some of the things I learnt into my existing Jim Jarmusch-tribute page. After, I worked a few hours on my website http://www.bohemiancodes.com/education

**Thoughts**: I am delighted by how great it is to learn Bootstrap and how much fun it is to use it. I understand that learning mobile-first and general responsive design is a key skill for future jobs.

### Day 5: May 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: A full Bootstrap Saturday. Ray's course again, and advancing slooooowwwwwly with my freeCodeCamp portfolio project. 

**Thoughts**: Today I found Bootstrap confusing, probably because I work with only a little knowledge while I feel quite confident with CSS already. I am happy with the look of the page though.

### Day 7: May 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally tipped my toe into JavaScript. Not much of coding today, rather setting myself up for learning how to actually program!... I &hearts; lynda.com

<!--**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
