**Today's Progress**: Started working on freeCodeCamp's jQuery challenges

**Thoughts:** Re-gaining some motivation, I think there is an amazing coding community out there and a whole world to explore.

### Day 2: May 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started the first freeCodeCamp project: Create a tribute page with Codepen and Bootstrap. 

**Thoughts**: I just got thrown into cold Bootstrap water. Luckily there is W3Schools and Ray Vilalobos!

### Day 3: May 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Tribute Page on freeCodeCamp, and continued with Ray Villalobos' course "Bootstrap 4" on lynda.com

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap is cool and fun. But I do have to keep notebook and pen closeby while learning all the bootrap css classes.
